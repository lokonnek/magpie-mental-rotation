# Mental Rotation Task

This repository contains a basic mental rotation task using materials from Ganis & Kievit (2015).

Ganis, G. and Kievit, R.A., 2015. A New Set of Three-Dimensional Shapes for Investigating Mental Rotation Processes: Validation Data and Stimulus Set. Journal of Open Psychology Data, 3(1), p.e3. DOI: http://doi.org/10.5334/jopd.ai
## Experiment

The experiment uses a 2 (rotation: 50 degrees, 150 degrees) x 2 (match: same, different) within subjects design.

Participants view 48 pairs of images of 3D shapes and respond (forced binary choice) whether the images depict the same shape or different shapes (when rotated).
